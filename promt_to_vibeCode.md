# Financial Accounting System Prompt

## Core Accounting Structure

I want to create a hierarchical account structure for:

- Assets
- Liabilities
- Owner's Equity
- Expenses
- Revenues

This accounting system will implement the American journal format.
Transactions will be:

1. Recorded in journal entries
2. Posted to ledger accounts
3. End balances transferred to trial balance
4. Used to create financial statements (balance sheet and income statement)

## Technical Requirements

The application will:

- Work with SQLite (using sqflite_common_ffi package) in Windows
- Use BLoC pattern for state management
- Implement double-entry bookkeeping (debits = credits)
- Support hierarchical account organization
- Generate comprehensive financial reports

## Development Process

1. Design the database schema for accounts, journals, and ledgers
2. Create the data models and repositories
3. Implement BLoC pattern for business logic
4. Build the UI components for account management, journal entries, and reporting
